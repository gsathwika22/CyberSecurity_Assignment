# CyberSecurity_Assignment
# Deep Learning IoT Intrusion Detection

# Description
Intrusion detection system for IoT data using deep learning with focal loss (supports imbalanced traffic).

# Usage
- Install requirements: tensorflow, pandas, scikit-learn, shap
- Place your dataset: data/iot_data.csv
- Train: python model/train.py
- Model and logs saved in results/

# Improvements
- Handles class imbalance with focal loss
- Modular for easy dataset/model extension
- XAI integration (SHAP) for explanations

This explains the core idea and relevance of your IDS model and project for IoT security.An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) helps monitor network traffic and system activities to identify unauthorized access and cyberattacks in IoT environments. IDS solutions use machine learning or deep learning models to distinguish between normal operations and malicious behavior. The focal loss function is useful for imbalanced data, helping to improve the detection of rare attacks in IoT networks. IDS is essential for protecting smart devices from evolving security threats and ensuring the safety of digital infrastructure.
